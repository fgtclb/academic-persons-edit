What does it do?
================

This extension provides the option to connect person profils from `EXT_academic_persons
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/academic_persons>`__ to TYPO3 frontend users.

In addition this extension provides plugins to choose and edit an assigned profile. Therefore a frontend user with
an assigned person profile has to be logged in.
